## clean Architecture
* In this project I'm using [clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
and also ``MVVM`` as an application architecture adopted from the architecture blueprints sample.

## searching
* i'm using Full Text Search (FTS) algorithm in this project, also i have migrated it to Room DataBase to use it instead of regular SQL search
, it is faster and more reliable.

## sorting
* i've tried sorting algorithm like selection sort, insertion sort and quick sort
i have ended with that quick sort is the fastest one and by the magic of luck kotlin by default uses quick sort in sort Ext Fun.

## Implementation

* Using Dagger Hilt for dependency injection that will make testing easier and our make code
cleaner and more readable.
* Using Retrofit library to handle the APIs stuff.
* Using Room for caching movies.
* Using StateFlow for handling ui states.
